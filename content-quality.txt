## Evaluation Criteria

### 1. PROBLEM STATEMENT QUALITY (Score: X/5)

Evaluate against these standards:

#### Structure & Readability
- ✅ **GOOD**: Business context (3-4 lines) → Product Requirements (bullets) → Technical Considerations (bullets)
- ✅ **GOOD**: Uses small paragraphs and bullet points for easy scanning and comprehension
- ✅ **GOOD**: Well-formatted with clear sections and whitespace
- ❌ **POOR**: Heavily bloated with large paragraphs that make it unreadable
- ❌ **POOR**: Wall of text without proper formatting or bullet points
- ❌ **POOR**: Unstructured content that is difficult to parse

#### Problem Scope
- ✅ **GOOD**: Broad, open-ended problem allowing multiple solution paths
- ❌ **POOR**: Narrow, prescriptive instructions with single solution path

#### Level of Hand-Holding
- ✅ **GOOD**: Product Manager style with clear expectations ("what is expected", "what do we need") without prescribing technical implementation
- ✅ **GOOD**: Describes desired outcomes and business requirements
- ❌ **POOR**: Guides candidates on literal technical implementation (e.g., "use useState hook", "create a function called X", "implement using pattern Y")
- ❌ **POOR**: Contains detailed step-by-step technical instructions

**Note:** Clear product-level expectations are acceptable and even encouraged. The violation occurs when the problem statement crosses into technical implementation guidance.

#### Writing Style
- ✅ **GOOD**: Product Manager style - describes what needs to be achieved from a product/business perspective
- ❌ **POOR**: Engineering style - describes how to implement technically

#### Requirements Design
- ✅ **GOOD**: Contains "good-to-have" requirements alongside core requirements
- ❌ **POOR**: Only mandatory requirements with no optional enhancements

#### Real-World Alignment
- ✅ **GOOD**: Reflects actual product development scenarios
- ❌ **POOR**: Artificial, academic-style problems

**Scoring Guide:**
- **5/5**: Perfect structure with excellent formatting (small paragraphs, bullet points), PM-style, open-ended, clear expectations without technical implementation guidance, includes optional requirements
- **4/5**: Good structure and formatting, mostly PM-style, minor technical hand-holding present
- **3/5**: Acceptable but has formatting issues (some bloated paragraphs), structural issues, or moderate technical hand-holding
- **2/5**: Poor formatting (heavily bloated paragraphs), poor structure, engineering-style, or significant technical hand-holding
- **1/5**: Unreadable due to formatting, unstructured, overly prescriptive with technical details, or fails multiple criteria

**Required in your report:**
- Score with justification (in context of this specific problem statement)
- Assessment of formatting quality (use of bullet points, paragraph size, readability)
- Specific references to problematic sections (quote them)
- List of concerns found (including formatting issues like bloated paragraphs)
- Brief suggestions for improvement

---

### 2. CONCEPT COVERAGE (Score: X/5)

Evaluate whether the problem statement has adequate scope in terms of concept variety, considering the problem should be solvable in approximately 40-50 minutes:

#### Concept Variety
- ✅ **GOOD**: Covers multiple related concepts that work together (e.g., state management + data fetching + UI updates)
- ✅ **GOOD**: Requires applying different programming concepts to complete the task
- ❌ **POOR**: Focuses on only one narrow concept or trivial variations of the same concept

#### Appropriate Scope for Time Limit
- ✅ **GOOD**: Achievable in 40-50 minutes while still testing multiple concepts
- ❌ **POOR**: Too narrow (solvable in 10 minutes) or too broad (requires 2+ hours)

#### Depth vs. Breadth Balance
- ✅ **GOOD**: Requires reasonable depth in a few key concepts rather than superficial coverage of many
- ❌ **POOR**: Either too shallow (only surface-level understanding) or too deep (requires expert-level knowledge)

#### Problem Context Relevance
- ✅ **GOOD**: Concepts are naturally related and form a cohesive problem
- ❌ **POOR**: Artificially combines unrelated concepts just to increase variety

**Scoring Guide:**
- **5/5**: Excellent variety of related concepts, perfectly scoped for 40-50 minutes, good depth
- **4/5**: Good concept coverage with minor scope or depth issues
- **3/5**: Adequate concepts but limited variety or questionable time scope
- **2/5**: Narrow concept coverage or poorly scoped for time limit
- **1/5**: Trivial single-concept problem or unrealistic scope

**Required in your report:**
- Score with justification (in context of this specific problem statement)
- List of concepts being covered
- Assessment of scope appropriateness for 40-50 minute time limit
- Gaps in concept variety

---

### 3. QUALITY OF TEST CASES (Score: X/5)

Evaluate the **unit test cases** that are relevant to the given problem statement. **Note:** Ignore any test files in the base code that are not related to the problem statement being evaluated.

#### Scenario Coverage
- ✅ **GOOD**: Covers happy paths, edge cases, boundary conditions, and error scenarios
- ✅ **GOOD**: Tests input validation and invalid data handling
- ✅ **GOOD**: Tests for expected business logic outcomes
- ❌ **POOR**: Only tests happy path scenarios
- ❌ **POOR**: Missing critical edge cases or error conditions

#### Test Quality & Best Practices
- ✅ Clear, descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- ✅ Tests are isolated and independent (no shared state between tests)
- ✅ Proper use of test setup/teardown (beforeEach, afterEach, etc.)
- ✅ Uses appropriate assertions and matchers
- ✅ Tests one thing at a time (single responsibility per test)
- ✅ Mock/stub external dependencies appropriately
- ❌ **POOR**: Generic or unclear test names
- ❌ **POOR**: Tests have dependencies on each other or shared state
- ❌ **POOR**: Overly complex tests that test multiple things

#### Test Organization
- ✅ **GOOD**: Well-structured test suites with logical grouping (describe/context blocks)
- ✅ **GOOD**: Test files are properly organized and named
- ❌ **POOR**: Disorganized tests without clear structure

#### Completeness
- ✅ **GOOD**: Adequate number of test cases for the problem complexity
- ✅ **GOOD**: Tests align with problem statement requirements
- ❌ **POOR**: Insufficient tests for the stated requirements
- ❌ **POOR**: Tests don't match the problem statement

**Scoring Guide:**

## Critical Review Principles

Remember to maintain these principles throughout your review:

1. **Be Highly Critical**: Score strictly. A 5/5 should be exceptional and rare.

2. **Context-Aware Scoring**: All scoring and evaluation must be done in the context of the specific problem statement being reviewed. What works for one problem may not work for another.

3. **Focus on Concerns**: Spend 80% of your analysis on problems and gaps, not strengths.

4. **Provide Evidence**: Always reference specific sections, quote problematic code/text.

5. **Be Specific**: Instead of "poor quality," say "missing input validation on line 23" or "problem statement contains prescriptive steps in paragraph 2."

6. **Use Comparisons**: Compare against the provided guidelines explicitly.

7. **Actionable Feedback**: Every concern should have a clear implication for improvement.

8. **No Sugar-Coating**: If something is poor quality, state it directly.

9. **Prioritize Severity**: Highlight critical issues (security, correctness) over minor style issues.

---

## Example Scoring Mindset

- **5/5**: Exceeds all standards, production-ready, exemplary
- **4/5**: Meets all standards with minor polish needed
- **3/5**: Meets minimum standards but has notable gaps
- **2/5**: Falls below standards in multiple areas
- **1/5**: Unacceptable quality, major overhaul needed

Default to lower scores when in doubt. It's better to be overly critical than to overlook issues.
